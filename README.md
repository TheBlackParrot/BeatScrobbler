> [!NOTE]
> This is the third time the mod has seemingly changed hands. The original author, lfropc, started it [here](https://github.com/Ifropc/LastFmScrobbler). furryaccount then took it over for 1.29 [here](https://github.com/furryaccount), and I've updated it for 1.40.x upon request for WearyOlly.
